think about storing the expiry time of accesstoken
write a logic to refresh accesstoken when the expiry time is closer

think of using a sql db (postgres, mysql) to store credential table

think about implementing an authentication mechanism, to authenticate and store the accesstoken once the user is signup
to implement this feature we may need a frontend, which will redirect us to our backend
